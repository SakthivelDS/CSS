When elements are floated, the elements are hidden by the regular flow of the HTML.

Floating elements:
syntax:
float: right or left

To define an element that it should not have anything 
floated on its left:
use:
clear: left or right or both;

To set position of an element which is also located in document flow:

position: relative;
top: <n>px;
left: <n>px:
the values define, from top and from left.

To set position of an element which is independent of the document flow:

position: absolute;
top: <n>px;
left: <n>px:
the values define, from top and from left.
