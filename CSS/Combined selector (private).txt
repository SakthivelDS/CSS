To create a private class selector 
so that the only selector tag can use 
also when other tags are defined with same class name. 
example: 
CSS:
 p.big {..} 

<p class="big">..</p>/*Works Here*/
 
<div class="big">..</div>/*Didn't works */

2. Child selector:
The direct child will get the style
Example:
CSS:
section > p {..}

1.<section>
<p>...</p>
</section>/* Works here*/
2.<article>
<p>...</p>
</article> /*didn't works */
3.<section>
<div>
<p>...</P>
</div>
</section> /*Didn't works as p is not a direct child */

3.Descendant selector:
The child of any form (child, grandchild, etc..) gets the style.

Syntax like example:

article p {...}
Here the p element whether it is direct or grand child of article 
gets the style not like child selector.
