padding - like the border but it is between the border and the content.
We can given values for each side:
example:
padding: 10px 10px 10px 10px;
margin : 10px 10px 10px 10px;
1-top
2-right
3-bottom
4-left
Shortcut for this is :
padding: 10px
it denotes 10px on all the sides.


Box-sizing:
It is used to set the full box size as content-box or border box.
to set the box size according to the predefined width.
Example:
body {
width: 10px;
box-sizing: border-box;
}
it defines the whole box size as 10px if we define border and padding also.


If we want to constrict the big content in a small box,
we can set less height but the content in the box will flow out.
so we can use "overflow: hidden for hiding, auto for scroll bar, scroll for both side scrolling."
